Building Microservices:

low coupling, high cohesion
Prematurely  decomposing  a  system  into  microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain. In many ways, having an existing codebase you want to decompose into microservices is much easier than trying togo to microservices from the beginning.

Service boundary - business vs technical slice
Shared DB is effectively a very large, shared API, also specific technology choice.
Sync vs async (optimistic). 
Style - request/response  or event-based.

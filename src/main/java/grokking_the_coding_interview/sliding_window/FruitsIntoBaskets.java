/**
 * Problem:
 * - Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
 * you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits
 * in each basket.
 * Constraints:
 * - Each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * - You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
 * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop
 * when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * Example:
 * - Input: fruits=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Can put 2 'C' in 1 basket and 1 'A' in other from
 * subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
 * Approach:
 * - Similar to "longest substring with k distinct characters" with k=2.
 * Cost:
 * - O(n) time, O(k) space where k is the number of characters in the map.

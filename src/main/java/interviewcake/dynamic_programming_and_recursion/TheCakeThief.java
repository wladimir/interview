/**
 * Problem:
 * Write a method maxDuffelBagValue() that takes an array of cake type objects and a weight capacity,
 * and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag can hold.
 * Also known as the unbounded knapsack problem.
 * Approach:
 * We use a bottom-up â†´ approach to find the max value at our duffel bag's weightCapacity
 * by finding the max value at every capacity from 0 to weightCapacity.
 * Cost:
 * O(n*k) time, and O(k) space, where n is number of types of cake and k is the capacity of the duffel bag.
